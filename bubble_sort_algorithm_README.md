# Quick Sort Algorithm
## 1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.
Sort the numbers in increasing order.

Input:
- The array of numbers, called 'data'.

Output:
- The array of numbers in increasing order, called 'output'.

## 2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.
Variations:
- Pseudo-randomly ordered array
- Array already in increasing order
- Array in decreasing order
- Array that contains negative numbers

Edge Cases
- Array with duplicate numbers
- Array with one number in it
- Empty array

## 3. Come up with a solution for the problem. State it in plain English.


## 4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.


## 5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any.


## 6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6.
