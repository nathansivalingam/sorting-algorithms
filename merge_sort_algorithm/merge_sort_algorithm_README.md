# Merge Sort Algorithm
## 1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.
Sort an array of data to be in increasing order. The algorithm must have a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n)

Input:
- Array of numbers.

Output
- The same array of numbers organised into increasing order.

## 2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.
Expected Case:
- Pseudo-randomly ordered array
- Array already in increasing order
- Array in decreasing order
- Array containing negative numbers
- Array containing non-integer numbers

Edge Cases:
- Empty array
- Array with one element
- Array with duplicate numbers

## 3. Come up with a solution for the problem. State it in plain English.
Merge Sort

## 4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.


## 5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any.
- The worst-case time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n).

## 6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6.
Next steps:
- Try and create a visualizer to help others understand merge sort.
- Maybe it would highlight which lines of code are being run adjacents to a visual aid.
